//    Create a class that has three fields: startX, startY, length.
//    Then write a method that accepts an array of integers and returns a list of battleships.
//    The input array is structured in a following way:
//            [ [ship1_startX, ship1_startY, ship1_length], [ship2_startX, ship2_startY, ship2_length], ...]
